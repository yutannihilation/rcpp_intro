# Preface

Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It is implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R, so it is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++. And because Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can get high performance results.

This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint of C++, it explains conceptually so that the user can easily understand it.

I would greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me some feedback on this document.
